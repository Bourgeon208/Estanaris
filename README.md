# Estanaris
Estanaris is a textual RPG destined to be a MMORPG in the future.
Rules of the game are a alternate version of PF2e the tabletop RPG.
The universe of the game is purely original and inspired by several video game universes, books and movies.
The game is at a really early stage and isn't actually playable.
It's main purpose at the time is only to train myself in code developpement and explore the possibilties in a fun way of libraries such as Flask.
